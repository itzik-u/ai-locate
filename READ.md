# Locate AI

A cutting-edge geolocation application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and identify locations from images and videos.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Locate AI is a powerful tool that leverages the latest in computer vision and artificial intelligence to identify geographic locations from visual content. The application provides a modern, cyberpunk-inspired interface that makes it easy to upload media and visualize the results on an interactive 3D globe.

- **Real-time Progress**: Watch the analysis progress with a percentage counter

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React.js
- Cesium for 3D globe visualization
- CSS animations and transitions
- Font Awesome icons
- Vite for fast development and building

### Backend
- Python
- Flask for API endpoints
- OpenAI integration for AI analysis
- Scrapingdog API for additional data
- Image and video processing libraries

## üìã Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Scrapingdog API key

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itzik-u/ai-locate.git
   cd ai-locate/Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../Backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI=your_openai_api_key_here
   SCRAPINGDOG=your_scrapingdog_api_key_here
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

## üîç How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser (default: http://localhost:5173)
2. Click the upload button to select an image or video file
3. Click the analyze button to start the AI analysis
4. Watch as the globe zooms to the identified location and places a marker
5. Click the details button to see in-depth analysis and reasoning
6. Explore alternative location suggestions and confidence levels

## üåü Future Improvements
